# Installation
  
## Requirements

- JDK 1.7 or higher

## Build the software

To build the software do:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

## Releasing a new version

We use the [Axion Release Plugin](https://github.com/allegro/axion-release-plugin) to release new versions.
This is part of the GitHub pipeline and should normally only be done there.
